Final Proposal

1. 
  I want to make a simple scene with a bunch of shapes, spheres, cubes, pyramids, etc.  These shapes
will fall using the a physics engine and bounce on a plane.  Each set of shapes will be textured a certain way.
A cool stretch goal would be to allow the user to use the mouse to change the path of the objects while falling
or on the ground.

2.
  Week #1 - Do some research on Three.js and Physi.sj as both will be used in this project.  Also can
  start creating the overall scene.  A plane that the objects can land and bounce on.
  
  Week #2 - Complete rendering the objects.  Spheres will be the most important because they would be 
  most interesting boucing in my opinion.  However if time permits i can add other objects as well.
  
  Week #3 - Start working on the physics system.  I have an idea this will take longer then a single week,
  however it should be started by at least this week.  Also will start to texture the objects at this point as well.
  
  Week #4 - Start working on a system to allow the user to rotate camera around the scene to allow views 
  from more angles.
  
  Week #5 - If time permits(stretch goal), add the ability for the user to move the objects themselves.  
  Probably with the mouse.

    As i have stated before, i will definitely be using Three.js as well as Physi.js for this project.
